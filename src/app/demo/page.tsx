            <p>Custody Folio helps parents organize custody notes and supporting files for an attorney meeting or custody proceeding. Remove the emotion. Track the data. This walkthrough uses fictional examples and synthetic narration.</p>
            <p>Start with one dated record. Add what happened and keep the supporting details with it. You do not need an account for the other parent. Home also gives you a direct route to building a PDF or sharing with an attorney.</p>
            <p>The timeline brings dated entries together. Open Options to choose the date range, filter the kinds of records you want to review, and check the details before exporting. The purpose is to make your own records easier to find and follow.</p>
            <p>Here is an actual sample PDF export. Notice the factual description: scheduled pickup at six, actual pickup at six fifteen. Compare every report with the original records before sharing. A report organizes what you entered; it does not verify an allegation or guarantee court acceptance.</p>
            <p>The picture to PDF builder lets you select screenshots and arrange them into a printable document. Add a neutral title and description, review the page order, and keep the original pictures for reference. This is the starting screen before selecting any images.</p>
            <p>Attorney access is optional. Choose a case and authorize sharing, enter the attorney’s exact email, and send the private invitation link yourself. The attorney verifies that mailbox with a one-time code. Access is read-only, with downloads available. You can revoke future access, but you cannot recall copies already downloaded. Sharing does not establish representation.</p>
            <p>This is the starting point for Custody Folio. The core tools are available now, and feedback will help guide what improves and what comes next. What takes the most time when you organize records? What would make a report easier to review? You can give feedback using a fictional example without sharing personal case details.</p>
            <p>Visit custody folio dot com to try the web app free for thirty days, with no card required. Web access is five dollars and ninety-nine cents monthly, or fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents annually. Custody Folio helps organize records and does not provide legal advice.</p>
